# Aerial Imagery Classification

This initial phase of the project uses a convolutional neural network and northing/easting coordinate data to classify aerial photos into one of five different land use categories.  Subsequent stages will implement more categories and additional image analysis to increase overall accuracy to aid with classifying images and/or identifying those images that require human judgment to properly categorize.

Included is a Powerpoint presentation outlining the early phases of the project.
