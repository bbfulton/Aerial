# Aerial Imagery Classification

This initial phase of the project use a convolutional neural network to classify aerial photography into one of five different land use categories.  Subsequent stages will implement more categories and additional image analysis to increase overall accuracy to aid with classifying images and/or identifying those images that require human judgment to properly categorize.
